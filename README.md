# Disease Pattern Miner App (DPM)

The ability to learn new things from electronic medical data has grown significantly in recent years. To extract novel disease patterns from these records, computational techniques are frequently used. 
The demand for extensive data collections and pre-processing of those collections, as well as a lack of visual user interfaces to understand disease patterns, is a barrier.
